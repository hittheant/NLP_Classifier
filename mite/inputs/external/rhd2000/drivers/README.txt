Under Windows, it is important to install the USB drivers BEFORE
connecting the controller to the computer.

To install the drivers, simply go to the Windows directory and copy the
FrontPanelUSB-DriverOnly-4.2.5.exe file to your computer.  Double-click
this file to run the installer.  Follow the instructions, and the driver
will install quickly.

The Linux directory contains a file called 60-opalkelly.rules.  Follow
the directions in LINUX_README.txt for instructions on adding this file
to your directory structure.
